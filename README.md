# javascript-KeyPress-EventListeners
Basic JavaScript script to handle multiple keypress events and log onto the screen.


This Project aims to create a structure where event listeners in JavaScript are used to log multiple keyboard key presses, in order to better understand and test the reliability and precision of these commands using different javaScript syntaxes and structures.

How to Test Run:

Run the index.html file on a Browser environment

Press any of the given keys, hold, release and press multiple at once to see them populate the screen, revealing the response time.
